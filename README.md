<h1>Pok√©mon Go 0.39 Forced Update - Necrobot is Down!
</h1>
<strong>
Niantic has forced minimum version of Pokebot clients to 0.39.  So all bots, map scanners, and other unauthorized clients are going to go down until the new API has been cracked.

Do not attempt to connect with any bot or else you will be flagged as a bot since all bots use the 0.35 API and real apps use 0.39 API.
